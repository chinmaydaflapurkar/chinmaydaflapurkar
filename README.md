- Social media is being used by both new and established brands to generate leads, increase sales, and increase their following. When you consider how many social media platforms are available, it can seem like a daunting task to build a brand. You can use social media to grow your brand organically and connect with people.
You can always improve on social media platforms, even if you've been active for years. There are different uses for each platform.
You will learn how to apply social media tips and tricks to optimize your marketing strategy in this article. Following that, we'll give suggestions for how to get the most out of each of the top social media platforms.
Below are the some of the tips including any platform:

1.	Develop a social media strategy specific to each platform- You need to have a specific and intentional plan for each of the platforms you use just as you do for the other aspects of your marketing plan. Engagement can be generated in several ways depending on the platform. You may not have to advertise on every platform, but if you want to target your content properly, you should make sure that the strategy you use is suitable for that platform. You should be able to answer questions like:
•	Why am I using this platform?
•	Who will reach on this platform?
•	What post types work best on this platform?
•	How are my posts unique to this platform?

2.	Be consistent - Posting frequency should be determined by the social media site you are using. Depending on the platform, you might need to post multiple times per day to reach your audience's maximum potential. Post types such as Facebook updates and regular Instagram posts don't require as much urgency and are less time-consuming to use. Think about things such as how the algorithms for each platform work, and whether content posts chronologically or is curated based on other factors when deciding how to post.

3.	Make sure your message is clear- You will have a different demographic for each platform you use. On each platform, you'll find overlapping audiences. However, understanding your demographics is vital for making sure your message is tailored to have the most impact. You will be able to create relevant content that speaks to your audience by having a focused message. A solid message that you don't stray from will help you post relevant content on social media that your followers will always find interesting.

4.	Watch out for what's trending - Keeping an eye on current trends on each platform is a good idea after you have determined your key messaging. Consider leveraging a popular strategy or pattern that aligns with your messaging to drive engagement. Do not get caught up in every new trend you see on the Internet. Posting non-aligned content to appear relevant will alienate your target audience quickly. If you see other brands creating a certain type of content, you may not have to create that type of content yourself.

5.	Analyze & measure results- Tracking and measuring your social media efforts can ensure that you are getting the best results possible. More than 40% of businesses do not track social media ROI accurately, so they don't know if their strategy is working. Select the metrics that matter most to your brand and simplify the tracking process.
